## How To Contribute
**MonoGame.Extended** has a `main` branch for stable releases only and the `develop` branch where new features and fixes are submitted.

**MonoGame.Extended** used the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).  You should learn and be familar with how to [use Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/), how to [create a fork of MonoGame.Extended](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), and how to [submit a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

All Pull Requests will trigger a GitHub action that will execute the test scripts against the changes being proposed.  Project maintainers and contributors will review your changes and provide constructive feedback where needed to improve your submission.

If you are looking for ways to contribute, you should start by looking at the [open issues](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/issues) on GitHub.  Please let us know if you plan to work on an issue so that others are not duplicating work.

## Quick Guidelines
Here are a few simple rules and suggestions to remember when contributing to **MonoGame.Extended**


- ‼️ **NEVER** commit code that you didn't personally write.
- ‼️ **NEVER** use decompiler tools to steal code and submit them as your own work.

- **PLEASE** try keep your PRs focused on a single topic and of a reasonable size or we may ask you to break it up.
- **PLEASE** be sure to write simple and descriptive commit messages.
- **DO NOT** surprise us with new APIs or big new features. Open an issue to discuss your ideas first.
- **DO NOT** reorder type members as it makes it difficult to compare code changes in a PR.
- **DO** give priority to the existing style of the file you're changing.
- **DO** try to add to our [unit tests](https://github.com/craftworkgames/MonoGame.Extended/tree/develop/tests) when adding new features or fixing bugs.

- **PLEASE** keep a civil and respectful tone when discussing and reviewing contributions.
- **PLEASE** tell others about **MonoGame.Extended** and your contributions via social media.

## Decompiler Tools
We prohibit tools like dotPeek, ILSpy, JustDecompile, or .NET Reflect which convert compiled assemblies into readable code.

It is **NEVER ACCEPTABLE** to decompile copyrighted assemblies and submit that code to the **MonoGame.Extended** project.

- It **DOES NOT** matter how much you change the code.
- It **DOES NOT** matter what country you live in or what your local laws say.
- It **DOES NOT** matter that XNA is discontinued.
- It **DOES NOT** matter how small the bit of code you have stolen is.
- It **DOES NOT** matter what your opinion is of stealing code.

If you did not write the code, you do not have ownership of the code, and you shouldn't submit it to **MonoGame.Extended**.

If we find a contribution in violation of copyright it will be immediately removed. We will bar that contributor from the **MonoGame.Extended** project.
